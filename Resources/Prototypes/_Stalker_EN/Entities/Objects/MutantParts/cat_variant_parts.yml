  name: Adapted Cat Gland
  description: A swollen gland from a bayun that has adapted to the Zone's psionic fields. The tissue pulses with a faint bioluminescence, and the chemical compounds within are far more potent than the standard variety. Ecologists studying psionic mutations pay well for specimens like this.

  name: Mutated Cat Gland
  description: A grotesquely enlarged gland from a bayun whose psionic abilities have mutated far beyond the norm. The organ emits a low hum that makes nearby stalkers uneasy, and the concentrated chloral compounds within could sedate a pseudogiant. Researchers at the Ecologist camps would pay top roubles for this specimen.

  name: Singular Cat Gland
  description: An extraordinary gland from a bayun of legendary power. The organ is crystalline in structure and radiates a warmth that numbs the mind of anyone holding it too long. The chemical cocktail within defies analysis with standard equipment. Only the most well-funded research stations could afford to acquire this, and they would pay handsomely for the privilege.
