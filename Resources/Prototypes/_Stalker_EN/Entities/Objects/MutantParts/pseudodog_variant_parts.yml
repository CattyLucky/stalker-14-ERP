  name: Adapted Pseudodog Tail
  description: A dark violet-tinged tail from a pseudodog that has hunted in anomaly corridors for years. The muscle fibers have become unusually dense, granting the creature explosive acceleration. Ecologists note elevated psionic residue in the nerve tissue, and Duty buys these to study pseudodog hunting patterns.

  name: Mutated Pseudodog Tail
  description: An electric-blue tail from a pseudodog whose fur crackles with residual static discharge. The creature appears to have developed a symbiotic relationship with electrical anomalies, channeling their energy through its nervous system. An extraordinary find for Ecologists and Duty researchers alike.

  name: Singular Pseudodog Tail
  description: A crimson-red tail radiating palpable heat from a pseudodog of terrifying power. Stalkers who have encountered such beasts report reality distortions in their wake, phantom images that persist long after the creature has gone. The psionic energy saturating this tissue is unlike anything documented. Both Ecologists and Duty would pay more for this than most artifacts are worth.
