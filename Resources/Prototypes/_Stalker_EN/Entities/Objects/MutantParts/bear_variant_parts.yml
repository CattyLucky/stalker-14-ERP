  name: Mutated Bear Claw
  description: A silver-grey claw from a bear whose coloring has shifted through prolonged anomaly exposure. The internal structure has become partially metallic. X-ray analysis reveals a lattice of mineral deposits woven through the keratin. Ecologists and Duty both seek specimens like this for their research programs.

  name: Singular Bear Claw
  description: A massive golden claw from a bear of near-mythical proportions. The surface shimmers with an iridescent sheen, and the tip is sharp enough to puncture reinforced body armor. Stalkers speak of golden bears that guard the hearts of anomaly fields. Ecologists and Duty would both pay more for this claw than most expeditions yield in a month.

  name: Adapted Bear Paw
  description: A massive, calloused paw from a Zone-hardened bear. The pad has thickened into a leathery shield resistant to chemical burns and radiation. Evidence of years spent traversing the most hostile terrain the Zone has to offer. Duty pays well for specimens that help them understand what their patrols are up against.

  name: Mutated Bear Paw
  description: A silver-tinged paw from a bear that has undergone radical mutation. The bones have partially fused, creating a club-like structure of devastating striking power. The fur has taken on a metallic sheen that deflects low-caliber rounds. Ecologists prize it for research, and Duty wants it for armor-penetration analysis.

  name: Singular Bear Paw
  description: An enormous golden paw from a legendary Zone bear. The sheer mass of this appendage defies biological norms. The claws are embedded with crystalline formations identical to artifact matter, and the pad radiates faint warmth even hours after harvest. Both the Ecologists and Duty consider specimens like this the key to understanding the Zone's endgame.

  name: Adapted Bear Eye
  description: A dark, psionic-tinged eye from a Zone bear with heightened psychic sensitivity. The iris has developed unusual refractive properties, suggesting the creature could perceive psionic energy fields directly. Valuable to Ecologists and Duty researchers studying Zone-born psychic phenomena.

  name: Mutated Bear Eye
  description: A teal-glowing eye from a psionically gifted bear whose mutation has reached an advanced stage. The pupil has expanded to fill nearly the entire iris, and the lens contains bioluminescent compounds that glow in darkness. Proximity causes mild psychic discomfort. Ecologists and Duty would both pay handsomely for this.

  description: A magenta-burning eye from a psi-bear of legendary psychic power. Even preserved, it induces vivid dreams in anyone who sleeps near it. The crystalline structures within the lens appear to store and amplify psionic energy indefinitely. Ecologists theorize this eye alone could power experimental psionic equipment. Duty would pay a king's ransom for this kind of intelligence on psionic threats. Truly one of a kind.
