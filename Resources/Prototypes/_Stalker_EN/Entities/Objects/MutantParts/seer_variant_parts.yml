  name: Mutated Frog Leg
  description: A bone-white leg from a seer whose body has been fundamentally altered by prolonged anomaly exposure. The musculature is unlike anything found in nature, with fibers arranged in a helical pattern that grants extraordinary jumping power. Ecologists studying locomotion mutations consider these specimens invaluable.
